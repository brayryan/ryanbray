    content: "The skateboard industry is mostly dominated by wood decks. Wood decks are preferred because of their comfortable feel and price. Composite decks have not been as popular mainly because of the availability and cost of materials. Recently the price of fiber reinforced composites has started to decline, which brings an opportunity to produce favorable composite decks. By using MATLAB to optimize a laminate, it is possible to create a board that has the same feel and similar price to a wood board. To achieve this, three design parameters were considered: cost of fibers, deflection under loading and maximum allowable load. The parameters were attained by looking at the number, orientation, and type of layers.",

    content: "The use of wooden baseball bats is one of the few traditions in professional baseball that has not lost its significance. A variety of types of wood bats (maple, ash, birch, and hickory) have been tested by players as they have tried to gain a competitive edge over their opponents. Today, most baseball bats used in the MLB are maple or ash. Failure has become an issue because broken bats can fly into the field or stands posing a threat to players and fans. Several factors like density, moisture content, slope of grain (SOG), and grain orientation affect the strength of the material. These parameters must be tightly controlled to improve bat performance and to reduce bat failure. Further study led to a change in the requirements of the Wooden Baseball Bat Specifications (WBBS), specifically maple bats. These bats must be manufactured with a minimum SOG of 3° with respect to the centerline and players using maple bats would be instructed to impact on the face grain.",

    content: "Solid state batteries (SSBs) are on the forefront of battery development in the industry today. This recently improved form of battery is making large advancements over the old battery technology. Solid state batteries offer higher energy density, longer battery life, faster charging times, and safer handling conditions. Solid electrolytes are a safer alternative to the liquid electrolyte because they are more stable. They are also less susceptible to dendritic short circuiting, have improved mechanical properties, and can also handle cathode and anode materials that have very high energy density, such as pure lithium metal. While solid-state batteries have made many advancements, they have faced many challenges during development. Solid electrolytes usually have conductivities 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those of liquid electrolytes which caused a challenge for engineers during the development process. This led to additional research being done to find ways to improve the ionic conductivity. While conductivity has been improved by researching new electrolytes and overcoming issues like grain boundary resistance, it ends up often being negated by high impedance due to interfacial instability. Solid-state batteries are also affected by dendrites in the form of protrusions of lithium. This can lead to short circuiting within the battery causing safety issues to arise. Furthermore, cost remains major concern when it comes to solid-state batteries. Research is ongoing to find solutions for these problems in solid-state batteries. One solution that consistently was mentioned in literature by a variety of authors, is the use of sulfide electrolytes like Li7P2S11 glass ceramic, which exhibit relatively high conductivity, good mechanical properties to prevent dendrite growth and resist instability, as well as low cost compared to oxide electrolytes.  Innovation plays a key role when it comes to improving solid state batteries and will continue to lead to advancements in electrolytes, electrodes, and their interfaces.",

Technology is reshaping an engineer's ability to design, develop, and promote products. This is why I decided to pursue this self driven project. The goal was to gain a better understanding of website development, product interactions, and visualizations while learning about innovative materials. Being involved in sports my whole life, I have always been interested in designing and improving equipment and apparel to allow athletes to reach their full potential. I explored the major issue of sustainability in the footwear industry, electronic textiles, and nanotechnology.",

    content: "Robotics and programming are becoming an increasingly valuable part of today’s engineering world.  Knowledge of robotics can help or hinder the ability of an individual to advance past problems and to grow further in their field of study.  Obtaining a general understanding of robotics and base programming can strengthen an individual’s chances for success in the long term. The Lego EV3 robot tournament consists of four separate teams creating a working robot to compete in a king of the hill competition. Teams were given the tasks of designing, prototyping, building, and programming an independently functioning robot. Instead of sticking with the Lego Commander App, it was decided to use a program called EV3DEV to control the robot. The additional effort proved successful allowing for much easier maneuvering, and ultimately, provided a significant advantage over the other teams. ",

    content: "Many consumers new to the wine industry claim that red or white wines all taste the same. However, many wine enthusiasts have different opinions. The science of winemaking is very complex and requires careful preparation and growing conditions. Things like the soil, climate, and how the vine is groomed can greatly change the outcome. Words used to describe the flavors and aromas of wine can range from strawberry to oak to even fresh rubber tennis ball. This leaves newcomers to wine skeptical of the validity behind these flavor profiles. The goal of the project is to determine whether wine connoisseurs can detect the difference in flavors and aromas between different varieties of wine. If so, how do things like price, points, and region affect the flavors or aroma of the wine. A dataset of 130 thousand wine reviews was analyzed. Python was used for data analysis which consisted of sorting and organizing by attribute, word frequency analysis and data visualizations such bar charts, line graphs, and word clouds.",
