Hi, I'm Ryan Bray. I plan to graduate in May of 2022 from Michigan State University with a bachelor's degree in Materials Science and Engineering. I have over two years of demonstrated work experience ranging from research to process engineering.  


I chose this career path because of my curiosity, interest in solving problems, and my drive to exceed expectations. The face of a satisfied customer is what I strive for!  I enjoy working with others to brainstorm ideas and alternatives to find solutions to real world problems. There is a certain satisfaction in accomplishing a challenging task and learning new skills.  My ideal work environment is full of positive people, teamwork, and learning opportunities where I can grow professionally and personally.
